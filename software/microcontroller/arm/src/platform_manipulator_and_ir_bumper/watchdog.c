/**
  \defgroup Watchdog
  The Watchdog timer resets the board in the event that it's not behaving as expected.
  This is more robust than using other kinds of timers, because in the worst case, when
  your app has malfunctioned, it can still reset since it's not relying on your app to
  actually be running.

  If you want to use it, specify the length of the countdown to watchdogEnable() and then
  periodically call watchdogReset() to reset the countdown.  If the countdown ever gets
  all the way to zero, the board will reset.

  \b Example
  \code
  watchdogEnable(2000); // start the countdown

  void MyTask()
  {
    while (1) {
      if (everything_is_normal()) {
        watchdogReset();
      }
      else {
        // if things are not normal, the timer is not reset and will eventually expire
      }
    }
  }
  \endcode
