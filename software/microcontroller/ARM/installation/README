Once downloaded, it will be necessary to uncompress this file.
To do that, open a console in the directory containing this downloaded file and just type:

tar xjvf arm-toolchain-linux-2.tar.bz2

Move this newly created directory with the following command:

sudo mv arm /usr/local/

And modify the PATH of the system:

echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/arm/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile

When everything is done, it's necessary to logout your session, and login a new one. 
By this way, the system will take your modifications in consideration.

After that, you just have to type  arm-elf-gcc --version   to verify that the installation of your new compiler is OK.
