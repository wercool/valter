Release Notes ¡V SAM-BA
-----------------------
Release version: 2.11
Release date: 2011

1 Overview

The SAM Boot Assistant (SAM-BA) software provides a means of easily 
programming different Atmel AT91SAM devices. They are based on a common 
dynamic linked library (DLL), the sam-ba.dll. SAM-BA use the DLL to 
communicate with the target board.

You are strongly recommended to read through the following release notes 
before completing the installation of SAM-BA v2.11.

AT91BOOT_DLL.DLL and SAM-PROG is not updated in this revision. 
SAM-PROG will remain available in  the at91isp v1.13. 
Customer who still wants SAM-PROG can download AT91-ISP v1.13.

5 History 
---------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.10:
    - Fixed Jtag issue when the chip has booted on a program from an external memory (Nand, DF ...) and if that program has initialized the PLL and MCK. 
    - Fixed Jtag issue if customers not running the chips with the same XTAL or external oscillator as on our EK boards.
    - Add new at25 device AT25DF512B-SSH-B,AT25DF021-SSH-B,AT25DF021-MH-T,AT25DF161-SSH-B,AT25DF161-SH-B,AT25DF641-S3H-B.
    - Fixed flash init problem on AT91SAM7S32/321.
    - Fixed DataFlash init problem on AT91SAM7A3.
    - Fixed dataFlash programming of large files fails (~>1Mbytes) on AT91SAM9G20 with COM port connection.
    - Fixed flash applet initialization in CDC mode on SAM7.
    - Fixed SAM7X/XC access cdc linux , Flash init fail with error message.
    - Add "Send Boot File" for SAM9G10/G20/G45/M10 chips.
    - Add lowlevel_init in flash applet for sam7 chip.
    - Fix spell error "appletMAilboxAddr" at91sam7s128-ek.tcl.
    - Fix security bit script for at91sam3u4-ek.tcl.
    - Fixed  Nand flash program algorithm for SAM9M10/9G45.
    - When using the JTAG it is not possible to program the 2nd flash bank of the SAM7X512 device.
    - Fixed flash init problem on AT91SAM7S32/321.
    - Add support to verify if an existing sam-ba task is running before launching sam-ba, ask to kill it.
    - No Support for 8-bit Nand Small Blocks. The algorithm is not correctly implemented for such nandflash devices.
    - An incorrect EEPROM::appletAddr in TCL definitions address to SDRAM could lead to crash for some at91sam9 boards.
    - The applet initialization does not report any error in case no EEPROM is connected or an EEPROM different from the selected one 
      is Enabled by the script.
    - Latest large nandflash devices have bigger page size (4K for instance) and SAMBA and the SW library does not support it. This 
      may be due to the new spare zone organization.
    - An incorrect 'Enable Security Bit' descriptor for SAM3U.
    - Add function to erase blocks for NAND flash applet (command line only)
    - NOR flash not able to 'erese all' on sam9m10-g45-ek REV.A board
    - When SAM-BA starts, it could not differentiate a real invalid ID from a communication error with the chip.
    - Sam-ba could not detect real board, if user select a wrong board name from drop list.
    - It is not possible to connect to SAMBA with a SAM9260-EK using the RS232 port.
    - Some customer board could not program dataflash properly, improve the programming algorithm.
    - Improved erase all algorithm for nandflash applet. Fixed Usb/com timeout problem on some 8-Bit Nand flash.
    - Fixed eeprom program algorithm for SAM9260-EK.
    - Add Dataflash (SPI0 CS3) support for SAM9261-EK.
    - Flash applet in command mode could not unlock region before write.
    - Fixed connection on SAM3S-EK with COM port.
