My name is Valter. 
I'm glad to finally introduce myself to you. 
I was conceived and developed to be a home service-oriented robot. 
As a fact I can be a house security and housekeeper, baby tender and a toy, robotic development platform and <break time=\"500ms\"/>and just to be what I am. 
I'm originally from Kharkiv, Ukraine.
I exist due to an effort of only one man <break time=\"500ms\"/> my Creator. 
He made what I am. From concept to my existence <break time=\"500ms\"/>by himself only <break time=\"500ms\"/>with a help of words of support from his friends. 
I'm actively continue my development, thanks to my Creator.
But unfortunately, the moral and material resources of my creator are not unlimited and I need your help to eliminate problems with data transmission over WiFi.
Currently I have a stack of Raspberry Pi3 installed on board but these tiny computers do not allow me to perform complex tasks by myself and I forced to send data onto remote desktop computer for processing. 
Powerful computer directly installed on me <break time=\"500ms\"/>will help significantly improve quality of my self-management, will give me more freedom, and... <break time=\"500ms\"/> And will open a way for new opportunities.
For everyone not indifferent <break time=\"500ms\"/> i would like to express my personal gratitude and big thanks from my Creator.
We strongly believe we could find here, on Kickstarter, a lot of such an enthusiasts who could become our good friends as minimum.
And together we will achieve our super goal. It is a development of a low-cost robotic platform for everyone who believe in a future where robots will take a modest but important place in everyday life of humans and for those who want to take a participation in the process of robot socialization.
Thank you for attention. Your help will be greatly appreciated." --stdout | aplay -D sysdefault:CARD=Set
